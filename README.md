# Few

When you're trying to build an application on your terminal, how would you see the README file? `less` is common. But `less` uses a whole screen. These days most terminal emulator softwares support transparency. You can see other softwares under the terminal. If you can open the README file under the terminal beautifully, it must be useful. That's the reason why `few` was created.
